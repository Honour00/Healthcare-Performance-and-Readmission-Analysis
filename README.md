## Project Overview  
Hospital readmissions place a heavy burden on healthcare systems ‚Äî financially, operationally, and in terms of patient outcomes.  

This analysis focuses on three key healthcare settings:  

1. **Community Health Services**  
2. **Hospital Support Services**  
3. **Daycare Services**  

For each, i evaluated:  
- Patient demographics (age, gender)  
- Admission and readmission trends  
- Diagnosis-specific readmission patterns  
- Survival and mortality rates  
- Contact/consultation methods efficiency  
- Care durations and their effect on readmissions  

The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to guide **resource allocation, care planning, and funding justification**.

## Dashboards & Key Insights  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Community Health Analysis

<img width="1080" height="1206" alt="image (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a72d1e2-7170-404f-9772-55f5e20535b5" />


**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **285**  
- Total Admissions: **1.4K**  
- Readmission Rate: **5.4%**  
- Average Age: **73 years**  
- Average Care Days: **67 days**  

**Insights**  
- Readmissions are **highest among patients aged 75‚Äì84 years (459 cases)**.  
- **Digestive system disorders** (28 cases) and **breast cancer** (18 cases) dominate readmissions.  
- Mortality is driven by **non-cancer diagnoses, digestive & brain disorders, and dementia**.  
- Face-to-face (463) and telephone (414) are main contact types, but telephone contact has low effectiveness.  
- Survival rate: **63.47%**, showing opportunities for improved care continuity.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hospital Support Analysis

<img width="1080" height="1187" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2adc66d0-2ac4-4d30-a5c3-e470fb49e2c5" />


**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **194**  
- Total Admissions: **875**  
- Readmission Rate: **17.7%**  
- Average Age: **76 years**  
- Average Care Days: **36 days**  

**Insights**  
- Readmissions are concentrated in **respiratory & digestive organ cancers**.  
- Elderly patients (65‚Äì84 years) are the most affected.  
- Most readmissions occur within **short (‚â§30 days) or medium stays**, hinting at premature discharge.  
- Face-to-face dominates (538 visits), while telehealth is underutilized (33).  
- Admissions surged between 2021‚Äì2023 before dropping in 2024.  
- Survival rate is nearly balanced (**52% vs 48% mortality**).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Daycare Analysis

<img width="1080" height="1191" alt="image (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573b4672-86a1-45d4-943d-87b26d389a29" />


**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **80**  
- Total Admissions: **333**  
- Readmission Rate: **16%**  
- Average Age: **65 years**  
- Average Care Days: **74 days**  

**Insights**  
- 1 in 6 patients return post-discharge ‚Üí discharge planning is a key gap.  
- Elderly (65‚Äì84 years) dominate readmissions.  
- **Breast cancer** and **digestive organ disorders** are leading causes of readmissions and deaths.  
- Survival rate is concerning: **only 52% survive** post-treatment.  
- Heavy reliance on traditional care: Face-to-Face (131) and Telephone (108).  

---

## Comparative Insights Across Settings
- **Elderly patients (65+ years)** are consistently at higher risk of readmission.  
- **Cancer-related diagnoses** (digestive, breast, respiratory) drive both readmissions and deaths.  
- **Care duration strongly correlates with readmission** ‚Üí premature discharges are risky.  
- **Telehealth services are underdeveloped**, limiting scalability of patient monitoring.  
- **Admissions increased sharply (2021‚Äì2023)**, showing rising demand on facilities.  

---

## Recommendations  

### Reduce Readmissions  
- Implement **post-discharge follow-up programs** (72-hour check-ins for high-risk patients).  
- Extend **care durations** when medically necessary.  
- Introduce **predictive risk scoring models** to flag high-risk patients.  

### Improve Operational Efficiency  
- **Scale up telehealth and remote monitoring** to reduce in-person demand.  
- Train staff in **transitional care planning** for chronic conditions.  
- Use admissions trends to **plan staffing, bed allocation, and logistics** proactively.  

### Enhance Patient Outcomes  
- Create **personalized care plans** for elderly and cancer patients.  
- Expand **community-based and caregiver-supported care programs**.  
- Strengthen **end-of-life care** for chronic, non-cancer conditions.  

### Funding & Policy Support  
- Use admission surge data (2021‚Äì2023) to justify **increased funding**.  
- Highlight survival rate gaps as a **call for investment in preventive care**.  
- Advocate for **digital health infrastructure** (EHR optimization, telemedicine).

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí Data visualization and dashboard design  
- **Excel** ‚Üí Data cleaning, preprocessing, and aggregation  
- **Descriptive & Comparative Analytics** ‚Üí Trend and pattern analysis  
- **Healthcare KPIs** ‚Üí Readmission rates, survival, LOS (length of stay)

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions in elderly and cancer patients to reduce hospital readmissions. By expanding telehealth services, improving discharge planning, and optimizing care durations, healthcare facilities can achieve both better patient outcomes and greater operational efficiency.  

The insights and strategies proposed can serve as a blueprint for **funding proposals, healthcare policy improvements, and long-term system planning**.
