# Healthcare Data Analysis: Readmission Rates & Operational Efficiency  

This repository contains a **comprehensive data analysis project** on patient admissions and readmissions, conducted for a healthcare facility. The objective of this study is to **reduce hospital readmission rates** and **improve operational efficiency**.  

The project leverages **Power BI for interactive dashboards** and **Excel/SQL for data cleaning and preprocessing**, providing both **visual insights** and **strategic recommendations**.  

## Project Overview  
Hospital readmissions place a heavy burden on healthcare systems ‚Äî financially, operationally, and in terms of patient outcomes.  

This analysis focuses on three key healthcare settings:  

1. **Community Health Services**  
2. **Hospital Support Services**  
3. **Daycare Services**  

For each, we evaluated:  
- Patient demographics (age, gender)  
- Admission and readmission trends  
- Diagnosis-specific readmission patterns  
- Survival and mortality rates  
- Contact/consultation methods efficiency  
- Care durations and their effect on readmissions  

The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to guide **resource allocation, care planning, and funding justification**.  

## Dashboards & Key Insights  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Community Health Analysis
**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **285**  
- Total Admissions: **1.4K**  
- Readmission Rate: **5.4%**  
- Average Age: **73 years**  
- Average Care Days: **67 days**  

**Insights**  
- Readmissions are **highest among patients aged 75‚Äì84 years (459 cases)**.  
- **Digestive system disorders** (28 cases) and **breast cancer** (18 cases) dominate readmissions.  
- Mortality is driven by **non-cancer diagnoses, digestive & brain disorders, and dementia**.  
- Face-to-face (463) and telephone (414) are main contact types, but telephone contact has low effectiveness.  
- Survival rate: **63.47%**, showing opportunities for improved care continuity.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hospital Support Analysis
**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **194**  
- Total Admissions: **875**  
- Readmission Rate: **17.7%**  
- Average Age: **76 years**  
- Average Care Days: **36 days**  

**Insights**  
- Readmissions are concentrated in **respiratory & digestive organ cancers**.  
- Elderly patients (65‚Äì84 years) are the most affected.  
- Most readmissions occur within **short (‚â§30 days) or medium stays**, hinting at premature discharge.  
- Face-to-face dominates (538 visits), while telehealth is underutilized (33).  
- Admissions surged between 2021‚Äì2023 before dropping in 2024.  
- Survival rate is nearly balanced (**52% vs 48% mortality**).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Daycare Analysis
**Metrics**  
- Total Patients: **80**  
- Total Admissions: **333**  
- Readmission Rate: **16%**  
- Average Age: **65 years**  
- Average Care Days: **74 days**  

**Insights**  
- 1 in 6 patients return post-discharge ‚Üí discharge planning is a key gap.  
- Elderly (65‚Äì84 years) dominate readmissions.  
- **Breast cancer** and **digestive organ disorders** are leading causes of readmissions and deaths.  
- Survival rate is concerning: **only 52% survive** post-treatment.  
- Heavy reliance on traditional care: Face-to-Face (131) and Telephone (108).  

---

## Comparative Insights Across Settings
- **Elderly patients (65+ years)** are consistently at higher risk of readmission.  
- **Cancer-related diagnoses** (digestive, breast, respiratory) drive both readmissions and deaths.  
- **Care duration strongly correlates with readmission** ‚Üí premature discharges are risky.  
- **Telehealth services are underdeveloped**, limiting scalability of patient monitoring.  
- **Admissions increased sharply (2021‚Äì2023)**, showing rising demand on facilities.  

---

## Recommendations  

### Reduce Readmissions  
- Implement **post-discharge follow-up programs** (72-hour check-ins for high-risk patients).  
- Extend **care durations** when medically necessary.  
- Introduce **predictive risk scoring models** to flag high-risk patients.  

### Improve Operational Efficiency  
- **Scale up telehealth and remote monitoring** to reduce in-person demand.  
- Train staff in **transitional care planning** for chronic conditions.  
- Use admissions trends to **plan staffing, bed allocation, and logistics** proactively.  

### Enhance Patient Outcomes  
- Create **personalized care plans** for elderly and cancer patients.  
- Expand **community-based and caregiver-supported care programs**.  
- Strengthen **end-of-life care** for chronic, non-cancer conditions.  

### Funding & Policy Support  
- Use admission surge data (2021‚Äì2023) to justify **increased funding**.  
- Highlight survival rate gaps as a **call for investment in preventive care**.  
- Advocate for **digital health infrastructure** (EHR optimization, telemedicine).
